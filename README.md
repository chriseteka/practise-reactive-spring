This is a simple project where I got to test out the following cool stuff on spring:
1. Reactive Spring (Web, data access, services, tests and lots more)
2. Test Containers and Docker
3. Travis CI
4. Spring cloud
5. Heroku

The project tries to show how to leverage multiple datasources, for this, we have
1. SQL DB ==> MySQL for this project
2. NoSQL DB ==> MongoDB for this project

Its gonna be fun.
